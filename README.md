# Jolt-Godot

I just followed this [tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/core_and_modules/binding_to_external_libraries.html), but for a simple lib Summator instead of TTS.

It compiles well and the godotExampleProject folder has a sample project that can run and execute Summator.
